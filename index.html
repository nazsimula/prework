    <p class="h2">The wings of the airplane are just one component of flight. There are actually four forces of flight that push the plane up, down, forward, or slow it down. These four forces of flight are lift, thrust, drag, and weight.[2]
            The Wright brothers invented and flew the first airplane in 1903. It is considered the world’s first “sustained and controlled heavier-than-air powered flight.” Their aircraft, the Wright Flyer, flew about 120 feet. Today, the newest Boeing 787 can fly 10,000 miles on a single tank of gas.[3]
            One the most deadly airplane accidents actually happened on the ground. In 1977, two fully loaded planes carrying a total of over 600 passengers collided head-on in the middle of the runway in what is now known as the Tenerife Accident, named after Tenerife Island where the accident occurred. Over 500 people died.[16]
            Increases in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere are increasing the incidents of airplane turbulence.[5]
            The oxygen in an airplane’s emergency oxygen masks lasts for only about 15 minutes.[5]
            English is the international language of flight. All flight controllers and all commercial pilots who fly on international flights are required to speak English.[2]
        .If anybody wishes to fly by plane, first he is to collect a ticket of the airlines he will travel. Then he is to arrive at the airport at least two hours before the night. Next, he is to pay the travel tax, collect his boarding card and get his luggage checked.
        Alter that he has to face the security and immigration and wait in the lounge for boarding the plane. Finally, he is to get on board the plane with the announcement of boarding.
